Condition variable
A condition variable is an object able to block the calling thread until notified to resume.

It uses a unique_lock (over a mutex) to lock the thread when one of its wait functions is called. The thread remains blocked until woken up by another thread that calls a notification function on the same condition_variable object.

Objects of type condition_variable always use unique_lock<mutex> to wait: for an alternative that works with any kind of lockable type, see condition_variable_any

Edit & Run


Possible output (thread order may vary):

10 threads ready to race...
thread 2
thread 0
thread 9
thread 4
thread 6
thread 8
thread 7
thread 5
thread 3
thread 1
